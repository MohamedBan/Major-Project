# what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
    Start learning p5.play as we discussed in class there are many useful functions that p5.play has that could have helped me such as pathfinding and while it did help that I innovated new stuff ideas to work for my code, it would have made my overall project better if I used p5.play as it would have not only help save time it would have also made it easy for me to go for my nice to have list such as adding inventory. It was also a disadvatage for learning from my classmates as when I asked how they attempted stuff such as pathfinding or weapons or inventory they told me they used p5.play so I couldn't learn from their code and more importantly their experiences in getting it working.

# did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
    Since I slightly shifted my focus on what my code should be 80% through (one way survival game) semester i realized I missed having a timer in my survival game as with a timer your able to keep track of how long you survived and maybe at the end of the game I could have put congrats you survived for this long.

# What was the hardest part of the project?
    I would say pathfinding as 70% way through the semester I realized I would need to add pathfinding but I realized I couldn't do it and p5.play required me to redo some of my code and I worried for quite a bit of handing an incomplete project but luckily I managed to pull through


# What is one thing your happiest about because of the project?
    One thing I'm happy about is that I chose a very ambitious project with lots of potential and I'm planning on keep on working on it and perfecting until it's something thats I can be proud of.
